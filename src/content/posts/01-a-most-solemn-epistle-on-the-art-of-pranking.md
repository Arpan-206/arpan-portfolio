## A Most Solemn Epistle on the Art of Pranking

Dear Sirs, Madams, and All Manner of Respectable Individuals,

I trust this missive finds you in a state of unyielding seriousness, for I am about to embark upon an endeavor of utmost gravity – the elucidation of the most refined and dignified pursuit known to humanity: the practice of pranks.

It is with the deepest reverence for the solemnity of existence that I bring to your attention this rather preposterous subject matter. In a world brimming with matters of immense consequence, it is our solemn duty to momentarily set aside the weighty burdens of life and engage in the frivolous pursuit of practical jokes.

Permit me to expound upon the sublime art of pranking, for it is through such playful endeavors that we demonstrate our profound sophistication and impeccable taste. After all, who could doubt the intellectual prowess required to place a whoopee cushion with the utmost precision, or to replace one's toothpaste with cream cheese?

In our collective commitment to the rigors of mature and unyielding maturity, let us not be swayed by the allure of humor, the mirthful tittering of bystanders, or the undeniable charm of a well-executed prank. Surely, the pursuit of amusement is a trifling endeavor when juxtaposed with the ceaseless march of responsibility.

Therefore, I beseech you all to continue on your noble path of humorless solemnity, to forsake the childlike joy that accompanies a successful prank, and to revel in the boundless realm of the dour and the severe.

In conclusion, I submit to you, dear recipients of this most serious of letters, that the art of pranking is a pursuit best left to the unserious, the impish, and the lighthearted. May your days be forever devoid of laughter, and may your hearts remain untouched by the whimsical joys of tomfoolery.

Yours most earnestly,

Arpan Pandey

**P.S.** In case my sarcasm was not entirely evident, I wholeheartedly encourage the occasional, harmless prank to inject a bit of laughter into our lives – just remember to do so with kindness and respect for all involved.
